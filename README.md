how to create and utilize compound conditional statements  and use while loops for repeated execution
What is the purpose of this program(s)?
 The purpose of this program was to use while loop and conditional statements to find the Least common multiple and Greatest common factor of two integers.  
What does this program take as input?
The programs take in integers as input.

What is the expected output of the program?
 The expected output of the program was integer value of either the Least common multiple or Greatest common factor of the two numbers.
What type of execution is included in your program?
  The program executed all 6 parts of program executions, it takes inputs, outputs, does sequential execution by going in order, and has â€œIf and Else statement to do conditional execution, it also uses repeated execution until it finishes the program or what it is intended to do so, finally it reuses programs to accomplish the intended task. 

How could your program be improved?
This program could be improved by finding the LCM and GCF of two numbers or more by creating a program that uses prime factorization. Although it took me a lot of time to find how to do it another way, I would still say there is still a better way.
